Raspberry Pi Remote Serial Protocol
===================================
Jamie Iles <jamie@jamieiles.com>

Purpose
-------

This implements a remote serial protocol (RSP) for GDB allowing debugging of
bare-metal applications on a Raspberry Pi without a JTAG debugger.

Architecture
------------

The RSP uses ARM's TrustZone to allow debugging of the user application
without requiring modification of the application.  The 2 entries to the RSP
are:

  - Data from the GDB host: this is received on the UART and raises a FIQ and
  FIQ's are configured to enter secure monitor mode.
  - Breakpoints: breakpoints are implemented with an SMC call to enter into
  secure monitor mode.

This implies that the application being debugged may not make use of the
security extensions.

Limitations
-----------

- Watchpoints aren't supported - there's no way to configure a watchpoint
trigger to enter the RSP without modification of the application and that
would need to be done carefully to avoid recursive loops in the RSP.

- FIQ's are reserved by the RSP.  The Broadcom SoC only allows 1 IRQ to be
configured as a FIQ and that's used by the RSP so applications must not use
FIQ's.

- Non-identity MMU mappings are not supported.  The RSP loads at a fixed
address and expects that not to change so if the application sets up a
non-identity MMU mapping the RSP will cease to function.  A future enhancement
will be to drop the application into non-secure mode (NS=1) and use the
address translation capabilities to perform all memory accesses from the RSP
and have that use it's own MMU configuration.
